# Air Quality Monitoring & Clustering System

This project is a Streamlit-based Air Quality Monitoring system that analyzes air pollution data and groups locations based on pollution levels using KMeans clustering. It also provides interactive visualizations to understand air quality patterns.

# Features

Upload air quality CSV dataset

Automatic data cleaning (handles missing values)

KMeans clustering of air quality data

Interactive scatter plots and heatmaps

Simple and user-friendly Streamlit UI

# Tech Stack

Python

Streamlit

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn

# Dataset

You can use air quality datasets from Kaggle (e.g. Air Quality Data in India).
Upload the CSV file directly in the Streamlit app.

# Output

Clustered air quality data

Pollution-based grouping using KMeans

Visual insights using graphs
